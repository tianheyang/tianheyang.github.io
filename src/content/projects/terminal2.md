## Summary
When CSS3, HTML5, and responsive design patterns first made their debut, I decided to rebuild my homepage with these latest advancements, plus a custom AJAX SPA engine.
## Technical Details
Before bootstrapped frameworks were a thing, I built this site with a [custom responsive CSS framework](https://github.com/tianheyang/mitosis-js), a homebrewed single-page-app JavaScript engine, and HTML5/CSS3 compliance.
