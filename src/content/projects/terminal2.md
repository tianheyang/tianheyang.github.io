## Inspiration
The theme of this website was inspired by a transport hub, because hubs help connect people much like the Internet does. An efficient transport hub should maximize delivery of people and cargo by leveraging multiple modes of transport, and a modern website should maximize the delivery of information by being optimized for multiple devices and screen sizes.
## Technical Details
Before bootstrapped frameworks were a thing, I built this site with a [custom responsive CSS framework](https://github.com/tianheyang/mitosis-js), a homebrewed single-page-app JavaScript engine, and HTML5/CSS3 compliance.
Years later, the forward-thinking foundations and lack of a heavy generalized framework allow the site to perform well on modern devices with minimal changes.
