## Summary
EdgeCast needed a responsive site for its open source projects, and I was given the opportunity to build one and to develop a new visual branding concept. This site is responsive and dynamically populated using AJAX via GitHub's API. Assets are device-dependent, with high resolution assets created for Retina-type displays.
