## Summary
I created vlnc with the belief that the goals of a social platform should align with those of its users. Traditional, advertising-focused social media was failing at this. Posts in vlnc feature a super-like option in addition to a standard like vote. Super-likes require a PayPal donation to the author of the post. By tying real-world value to the content, the hypothesis was that this should both elevate content quality and motivate more creators to share their knowledge and insights. Patrons gain social capital points and unlock special features.

## Technical Details
vlnc features a reactive frontend, pub/sub system in MeteorJS, and server-side functionality with PayPal integration in Node.js
