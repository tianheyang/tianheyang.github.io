## Summary
I served as a primary front-end resource at NationBuilder, and worked directly with the VP of design. I was the sole developer tasked with building out a full set of responsive website templates for our customers. These themes and their foundational architecture are still in use today. I developed a custom component-based library using native Rails partials, Liquid templates, and Saas variables.
