## Summary
I was tasked to create an online prescence for this manufacturer of bathroom cabinets, with a custom backend that allows authorized team members from within the company network to edit products. Information is organized into various "compartments," akin to drawers and cabinets on a vanity unit. A modern and muted page design and color scheme was chosen to complement the transitional and modern styles of the products.
