## Summary
I helped to architect and build a modern e-commerce funnel and other customer-facing pages, leveraging technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, and Cloudflare Workers. Other responsibilities included multivariate experimentation via integrations with LaunchDarkly, Segment, and Mixpanel; integration with the Ruby on Rails back-end; worked with engineers, designers, product managers, and directly with customers to investigate solutions and to drive cross-functional alignment.
